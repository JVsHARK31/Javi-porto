# üå∏ Smooth Animation Improvements

## ‚ú® Animation Enhancements Applied

### 1. **Sakura Petals Animation** üå∏
**Improvements:**
- Reduced petal count from 25 to 20 for better performance
- Added variable rotation speeds (0.5-1.5x) for each petal

- More responsive tap feedback (0.98‚Üí0.97)

### 4. **Social Media Icons** üì±
**Improvements:**
- Added initial scale animation (0.8‚Üí1)
- Wiggle rotation on hover instead of full spin
- Spring-based scaling with custom stiffness
- Softer shadow effects
- Staggered entrance with longer delays
- More playful hover interaction

**Hover Animation Sequence:**
```javascript
rotate: [0, -10, 10, -10, 0] // Wiggle effect
```

### 5. **Navigation Bar** üß≠
**Improvements:**

### 6. **Project Cards** üíº
**Improvements:**
- Removed aggressive 3D rotations
- Subtle scale on hover (1.02)
- Spring-based hover animations
- Viewport-based trigger with 30% threshold
- Smoother entrance with scale transformation
- Optimized stagger timing (0.2‚Üí0.15)

### 7. **Global Animation Settings** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Improvements:**
- Custom bezier curves throughout:
  - `[0.43, 0.13, 0.23, 0.96]` - Smooth ease-out
  - `[0.48, 0.15, 0.25, 1]` - Natural deceleration
  - `[0.455, 0.03, 0.515, 0.955]` - Organic movement
- Optimized spring configurations:
  - Lower stiffness values for gentler motion
  - Higher damping for less bouncing
  - Added mass property for weight simulation

## üéØ Performance Optimizations
